A common argument that is made for the cellulose contraction hypothesis is the
correlation between cellulose content and strain. Higher proportions of
cellulose compared to lignin correlate to tensile strains \cite{Sugiyama_1993}\cite{Qiu_2008}\cite{Yang_2006}, while high lignin
content correlates well to compressive strains \cite{ISI:A1991FD97000001}\cite{Okuyama_1998}. It has been well
reported that compression wood is partly characterised by an increase in
lignin content \cite{timell1986compression}, which has been used as an argument for the lignin
swelling hypothesis. Tension wood however is often but not necessarily
correlated with an increased proportion of cellulose. --tests on tension wood
with no G-layer-- Within tension wood of G-layer producing species tensile
strain and whole cell cellulose content correlate well due to the G-layer
having a very low lignin content \cite{gardiner2014biology}. The proportions of cellulose and lignin
within the cell after the G-layer has been removed do not share this correlation. \cite{timell1969chemical} found a higher concentration of lignin within the S2 layer than in normal wood when the G-layer was present.
