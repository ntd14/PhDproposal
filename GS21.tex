A common argument that is made for the cellulose contraction hypothesis is the
correlation between cellulose content and strain. Higher proportions of
cellulose compared to lignin correlate to tensile strains, while high lignin
content correlates well to compressive strains --refs--. It has been well
reported that compression wood is partly characterised by an increase in
lignin content --ref--, which has been used as an argument for the lignin
swelling hypothesis. Tension wood however is often but not necessarily
correlated with an increased proportion of cellulose. --tests on tension wood
with no G-layer-- Within tension wood of G-layer producing species tensile
strain and whole cell cellulose content correlate well due to the G-layer
having a very low lignin content --ref-- The proportions of cellulose and lignin
within the cell after the G-layer has been removed do not share this correlation
--ref--.
