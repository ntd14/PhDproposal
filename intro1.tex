With increasing height, width or off axis stems comes increasing gravitational
force, wind drag and internal pressures (for water transport), which requires
either enough redundant strength in the existing structure (such as in
monocotyledons) or for the tree to strengthen its structure as it increases its
size. In woody plants size increase and reorientation occurs in
two ways, apical and cambial growth on branches, roots and the stem(s).
