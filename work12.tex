The following properties are required:

The cell wall anatomy of different wood types (tension, normal and opposite)
needs to be investigated for the various NZDFI species (principally \textit{E.
bosistoana}). The anatomy study will consist of investigating which species
produce a G-layer (microscopy with staining \citep{Qiu_2008}), cell wall architecture
(atomic force and electron microscopy), % cellulose, lignin and other constituents
%mass fractions (acid hydrolysis combined with NMR spectroscopy) 
and the MFA and MFA standard deviation in all three wood types (X-ray diffraction).
%Fibre
%diameter, length and lumen size will also be obtained (Fibre Analyser). 
Within
tension wood the G-layer (in G-layer producing species) will be
removed in order to determine the secondary cell wall properties of tension wood
(enzymatic removal).
