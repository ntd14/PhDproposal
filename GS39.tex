There are currently a number of outstanding issues associated with all
of the current hypotheses/theories. When and how do the stresses get
generated is still of much debate, over the last couple of decades it has become
fairly widely accepted that the generation of the stresses occurs during or
immediately after the deposition of the secondary cell wall. Most commonly either
the G-Layer or the S2 layer are considered responsible. What the mechanism(s)
is within the cell wall has been hypothesised about at great length (as
discussed above), however no theory presented so far is without country
experimental evidence.
