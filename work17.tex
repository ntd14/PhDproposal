The following experiment is proposed in order to investigate the proportion of
the stem reorientation that is due to the G-layer. During growth tension wood
production is induced by forcing curvature into the living stem, as described
above. By introducing an enzyme treatment to the plant while it is still
transpiring it should be possible to degrade the G-layer and reverse any straightening that was caused
by the G-layer. With the G-layer removed the remaining stress can be released.
