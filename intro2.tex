Rays are formed from radially orientated cells often tracheids or parenchyma. Rays provide a mechanical advantage by diverting the axial force flow reducing buckling and shear stresses between fibres \cite{mattheck1997wood}. Many further cell types and functions exist, but more detailed wood anatomy and
has little bearing on this project and is discussed in a number of wood anatomy
texts \cite{fromm2013cellular}.
