Cambial cells divide in two ways, periclinal and anticlinal. Periclinal cell
division occurs to the inner and outer of the cambial layers. As the cell
division to the inside occurs the volume of secondary xylem that is being formed
increases the tangential stress on vascular cambium resulting in an extension of
the cambial circumference--ref--. --Anticlinal?--
