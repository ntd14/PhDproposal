Typically the S1 layer is thin and comprises of microfibrils winding around the
cell axis a a very high angle (MFA), within the layer many laminates are found.
Within each laminate the MFs are closely aligned, however between each laminate
they can (but do not necessarily) differ greatly, or even reverse the direction
of the helix the MFs form around the cell, although lower right to upper left
orientation tends to be favored \cite{fromm2013cellular}. Close to the S2 layer the MFA decreases
rapidly. The S2 layer bound to the inside of S1 is typically much thicker and
has more vertically oriented microfibrils compared to the primary, S1 and S3
layers, these MFs circle the cell axis from lower left to upper right. In
some cases, most commonly in late wood a thin S3 layer is also produced with
high MFA, reversing the direction of the MF helices to lower right to upper
left \cite{walker1993primary}.
