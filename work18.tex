Due to the expense, time, equipment and expertise required to test all of the
properties needed to parameterise the model presented in section \ref{subsection:Theoretical work} a number of
properties will be taken from literature and assumed to be a good approximation
for the current work. It is likely to be the case that a number of these
properties are not from Eucalyptus species.
