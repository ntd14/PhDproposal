\citet{boyd1950a} developed an experiment whereby he removed a wedge from a disk
and measured the radial expansion, showing the disks were under radial
tension. Additional species were found to be in agreement with the
results of \citet{jacobs1945l} when the inner circles were removed from disks. Boyd also shows
that the longitudinal stresses manifesting as transverse stresses via Poisson
ratios are only approximately one tenth that of the measured stresses.
