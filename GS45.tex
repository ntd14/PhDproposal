Other mathematical techniques have also been applied to plant cell walls, \cite{HEPWORTH_1998} used a discrete element approach, with limited results. Hydrogen bond dominated solids models have been used to describe paper \cite{nissan1997link}\cite{batten1987unified}\cite{nissan1987unified}\cite{batten1987unified}. \cite{Zhan_2014} used a representative volume element method to describe hardwood, however the resolution is above that of the cell wall. Recently molecular dynamics methods have been used to simulate small volumes of
the cell wall in order to investigate the nanostructure which may be present \cite{Charlier_2012}\cite{Zhang_2009}\cite{Sangha_2011}\cite{houtman1995cellulose}.
