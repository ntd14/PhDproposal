Many of the previous models have used a physical interpretation of the
reinforced matrix hypothesis \citep{Barber_1964} which describes the cell wall
as a two phase structure of cellulose fibrils and an isotropic hemicellulose and
lignin matrix. However until \citet{Yamamoto_2007} there was
no basis for this assumption. These authors provide a formal basis for validating
these assumptions.
