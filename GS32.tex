Many of the previous models have used a physical interpreatation of the
reinforced matrix hypothesis (barber and meylan) which describes the cell wall
as a two phase strucure of cellulose fibrils and an isotropic hemicellulose and
lignin matrix. However until Yamamoto and almeras 2007 (mori-tanaka) there was
no basis for this asumption. These authors provide a formal basis for validating
these asumptions.
