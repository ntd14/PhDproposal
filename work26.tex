The breeding work undertaken in the thesis will be limited to the investigation
of growth stresses in the NZDFI Woodville and Harewood \textit{E. bosistoana}
trials. No attempts will be made to predict growth stress magnitudes from
individuals or families, only a ranking of lowest to highest growth stress
producing families will be considered.
