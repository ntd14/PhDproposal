Tab. 3 shows the correlations between the family means of the measured wood properties while Tab. 4 shows the correlations at an individual tree level. The analysis included trees grown from seed and coppice. Acoustic velocity showed a good correlation with growth-strain at the family level but was only moderate at the individual tree level. Dry density showed moderate negative correlations with growth-strain. Diameter showed poor correlations with wood properties. All predictors were less strongly correlated with trees grown from coppice than trees grown from seed (data not shown). Testing for all of these properties can be conducted in less than five minutes per sample at trees as young as one year old. This for the first time allows a sizable wood quality improvement programme at reasonable cost.
