Currently the most advanced model for how growth stresses develop within the
cell wall was presented by \cite{Alm_ras_2005} using the unified hypothesis
(\cite{okuyama1986}, \cite{Okuyama_1994}, \cite{yamamoto1991}, \cite{ISI:A1992HP18200001} and \cite{Yamamoto_1998}) utilising both the lignin swelling and
cellulose contraction hypotheses. For details see section ---.
