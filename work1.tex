Currently the most advanced model for how growth stresses develop within the
cell wall was presented by Almeras et. al. (2005) using the unified hypothesis
(Okuyama et. al. 1986, Okuyama et. al. 1994, Yammamoto et. al. 1991, Yammamoto
et. al. 1992 and Yammamoto 1998) utilising both the lignin swelling and
cellulose contraction hypotheses. For details see section ---.
