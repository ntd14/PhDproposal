The second theory put forward in an attempt to correct the issues surrounding
cellulose lengthening during crystallisation is that 
hemicelluloses are trapped between the fibrils and cause them to bend and longitudinally contract. Mechanically this is very similar
to the lignin swelling hypothesis. By causing the MFs to no longer run straight,
instead they have to use some of their length to deviate passed a cluster of
hemicelluloses consequently shortening the over all distance the fibril can
cover.
