Due to the success of the previous trials NZDFI is currently setting up a 4168
plant trial with 81 families of \textit{E. bosistoana} (with an increase to ~160
expected in spring 2015), 336 seedlings over 13 families of \textit{E.
argophloia}. The trials are set up as alpha lattices and harvest is expected in
late 2016 or 2017. The intention is to have as much overlap as possible with the
existing genetics within the current and previous trials.
