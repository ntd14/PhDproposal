\cite{Chang_2013} investigated differences between normal and tension wood in poplar using FTIR. They found that cellulose is more orientated within the S2 wall of tension wood than normal wood, the orientation of lignin also increases in tension wood and that hemicelluloses and pectins in the G-layer are orientated perpendicular to that of the S2 layer.
