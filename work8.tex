Experimental evidence of the G-layer providing contraction within tension wood
has been presented by \citet{Goswami_2008}. Longitudinal extension and tangential
contraction were observed when the G-layer was enzymatically removed from
poplar tension wood samples. The S2 layer was reported to have a high MFA (36
degrees) as has been reported previously for other G-layer producing species
\citep{M_ller_2006}. \citet{Goswami_2008} suggested lateral swelling of the G-layer caused the
contraction.
