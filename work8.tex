Experimental evidence of the G-layer providing contraction within tension wood
has been presented by Goswami (2008). Longitudinal extension and tangential
contraction were observed when the G-layer was enzymatically removed from
tension wood poplar samples. The S2 layer was reported to have a high MFA (36
degrees) as has been reported previously and for other G-layer producing species
--refs--. Goswami (2008) suggested lateral swelling of the G-layer caused the
contraction.
