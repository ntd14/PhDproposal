Further Jacobs put forward a number of hypothesis to explain how the growth
stresses were forming. First arguing that it is very unlikely that dead cells
(wood) could extend within the core in order to create the observed stress
gradient. Instead suggesting the causes of; weight of the tree, surface tension
and sap stream forces, cellulose and colloidal complexes, lignin intercellular
substances and the primary or secondary cell wall. Although without any evidence
did not claim any of these to be the major cause.
