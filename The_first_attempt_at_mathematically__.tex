 The first attempt at mathematically defining a fibre or tracheid was a single layer two phase composite model consisting of the S2 layer composed of alighned cellulose fibrils and isotropic lignin \cite{Barber_1964}. This model was quickly improved on by \cite{mark1967cell} and \cite{Cave_1968} using continum mechanicas methods. \cite{mark1967cell} provides a very indepth discussion concerning both experimental and theoretical estimation of tracheids mechanical properties. \cite{Cave_1968} developed the model to include a gausian distroution of the MFA.
