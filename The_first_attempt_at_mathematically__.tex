 The first attempt at mathematically defining a fibre or tracheid was a single layer two phase composite model consisting of the S2 layer composed of cellulose and lignin \cite{Barber_1964}. This model was quickly improved on by \cite{mark1967cell} adding a number of cell wall layer --9? what did this achive-- \cite{Cave_1968} developed the model to include a gausian distroution of the MFA --why--. 
 
 --adition of the S1 layer
 --updated boundary conditions
 --Harington homogenisation scheme. 
 --swedish thesis
 
 --maybe a little on these advances, ----- Breifly discuss the math
tecneques used---Has any one used descrete or hybrid systems?--- L-systems--
