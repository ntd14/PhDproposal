\cite{boyd1977basic} reinvestigated most of the hypothesis available at the time
regarding the reason for the development of reaction wood. He argued that (as
had been previously rejected) the stress hypothesis, claiming that reaction wood
is a response to imposed stresses is the only available hypothesis which fits
the data, and that previous efforts to reject it had resulted from
misinterpreted results. In doing this he provides reasoning to reject the
hypothesis regarding gravitational responses, intrinsic growth direction, auxin
distribution and turgor pressure.
