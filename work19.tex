\subsection{Breading}
Because growth stresses cause a number of issues for harvesting and milling
timber, tree breeding programs can be used in order to select for
genetics which reduce these effects. There is no reason to expect  breeding for
growth stresses differs significantly from (conventionally) breeding trees for
any other trait. Over the last few decades many advances have been made in
experimental and statistical techniques which rapidly improve the time and
accuracy of conventional breeding.
