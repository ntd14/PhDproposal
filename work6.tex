The model is limited to a single unconstrained cell, which differs significantly
from a cell within a tree, due to the constraining effects of the surrounding
wood. Boundary conditions will be used to minimize this problem because modeling
a significantly large volume of wood is not feasible. The minimum resolution which
will be considered is the fibril aggregate, these are thought to be the smallest
structural components responsible for growth stresses under the lignin swelling
hypothesis.
