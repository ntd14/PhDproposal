Wood workers have unintentionally known of growth stresses within trees
for centuries. Usually referred to as `a pull towards the sap` when cutting boards good
craftsmen would section the log in such a way as to get a straight board once it
is removed from the log (and the growth stresses released) \citep{jacobs1945l}. Most work early on in
the study of growth stresses surrounded investigating how/why boards changed
shape when cut from an intact stem.
