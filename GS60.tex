Prolonged compression at the centre of the stem during growth can exceed the
elastic limit of the wood, resulting in internal defects such as brittle heart.
When the stem is felled these defects have already occurred. There is
no way to prevent them during felling, however selection for low growth stress
producing families can significantly reduce the occurrence of internal
defects.
