Rapid testing and genetic selection for growth stresses will continue to develop
tools needed for increasing the quality of the breeding stock of NZDFI
\textit{E. bosistoana} and help improve future breeding trials concerned with
growth strain. The project will deliver improved \textit{E. bosistoana} genetics with
reduced growth strain for propagation.
