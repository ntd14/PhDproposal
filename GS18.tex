The `on the distribution of growth stresses' series presented a comprehensive
mathematical framework for the treatment of the stress field within living
trees. Advancing on Kublers \cite{kubler1959a}\cite{kubler1959b} (in German, reviewed in \cite{Archer_1974}) work Archer introduced an orthotropic solution which
allowed for each new growth increment to alter the stress distribution within
the stem in a self equilibrating fashion. The other advancement made was the
increased accuracy from the crossover point from compression to tension now being
governed by the moduli in both the radial and tangential directions.
Archer went on to develop a numerical approximation to the stress fields
generated by asymmetric growth strains and inclined grains, allowing for
variation within growth stresses. Finely he used the developed methods to
present solutions for a number of hardwood species.
