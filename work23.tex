Note the term family is used here to mean the same mother, but not necessarily
the same father. If seeds are collected at different times even from the same
tree variability exists due to possibly of different set of fathers. Also some
Eucalyptus self propagate, but it is unknown which ones or what proportion of
seeds are self propagated within the NZDFI genetic material. Any effects of self
propagation are ignored.
