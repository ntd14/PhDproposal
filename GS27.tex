\cite{Yamamoto_1998} further refined the idea by introducing a much more rigorous frame
work, incorporating time dependence into the cell wall maturation model. The
work presented shows the failings of each lignin swelling and cellulose
contraction, even when time dependence is included. Time dependence does allow
for good agreement between the modeled unified hypothesis and experimental
values from sugi --ref--. The poor agreement with tangential stresses is
explained as being easy to decrease through stress relaxation in comparison to
the longitudinal stress when inside the trunk.
