It has been shown previously that these stresses are induced during secondary
cell wall formation, however the mechanism responsible is unknown. Two
hypotheses exist to explain the stress generation; 1) deposition of lignin
between the fibril aggregates causing the cell to expand or contract axially
depending on the orientation of the fibril (MFA), or 2) a mechanism resulting in
a length change of the cellulose itself causes cellular contraction or expansion
depending on the MFA. A combination of the two has also been proposed.
