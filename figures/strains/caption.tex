High (blue), medium (green) and low (red) growth-strain families grown from seed \textbf{A} and the same individuals grown from coppice \textbf{B}. Note the large number of trees in the low growth-strain families showing closure (zero) during the splitting test and the higher magnitudes of growth-strain when grown form coppice (\(\sim\) 200 plants from seed and \(\sim\) 200 from coppice).
