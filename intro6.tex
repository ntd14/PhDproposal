Primarily this work focuses on fibres as they are the structural cells expected
to be responsible for growth stresses in normal and reaction wood within
hardwoods \cite{archer1987growth}. Fibres consist of a number of cell wall layers. Normal wood fibres
consist of a middle laminar (ML, connecting the fibre to
the surrounding cells) a primary cell wall (P) and a secondary cell wall (S) consisting of
S1, S2 and S3 sub-layers (produced in chronological order so the overall composition
will change depending on the cells developmental stage) \cite{barnett1981xylem}. The S2 layer is
the thickest layer and consists of cellulose macrofibrils wrapped in a steep helix
around the cells longitudinal axis. The cellulose is contained within a
matrix of hemicelluloses and lignins giving the cell wall properties
of a reinforced composite \cite{niklas2012plant}.
