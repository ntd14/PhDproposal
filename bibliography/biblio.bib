(1) Longitudinal shrinkages in broadleaved trees which contained tension woods increased in proportion to the contractive released strains. Longitudinal shrinkages in the gelatinous layers were estimated to be about four times greater than those in normal cell walls: namely, the CMFs tended to contract largely in length as a result of the loss of water. This indicates the possibility that the CMFs contract and generate large tensile stresses in their axial directions also during cell maturation. (2) Contractive released strains increased as MFAs decreased and as the alpha-cellulose contents increased in sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) and yurinoki (Liriodendron tulipifera L.). (3) According to a simulation of the growth stress evolution by a cell model described in a previous report, the generation of tensile growth stresses was considered to be controlled by an interaction between the Young's modulus in the CMFs and the contractions of the CMFs in addition to the MFAs.}},

Numerous studies have been devoted to the cellulose microfibril arrangement, providing the longitudinal strength of the fiber, while less is known regarding the structural organization of other components, such as hemicelluloses and lignin. For the hemicelluloses, as being part of the cellulose aggregation process, indications of a strong coupling to the cellulose structure have been shown. For lignin, being laid down in a later stage, no clear picture has emerged. Here the orientation of lignin vis-à-vis the cellulose orientation was examined for a number of different fiber structures. It was shown that the lignin in the middle lamella region seems to be non-oriented, thus more resembling an isotropic material, while the lignin in the secondary wall is to some extent oriented. The orientation of this lignin is less pronounced than the orientation of cellulose but has a preferential alignment in the direction of the fiber axis. The reason for this alignment could be related to structural restrictions of this lignin, deposited in the spaces remaining after the initial forming of the structured cellulose/hemicellulose fibrillar structure.},

The critical MFA; namely, microfibril angle where the longitudinal growth stress switches from contraction to expansion, becomes quite larger than the experimental one in the case of using a usual cell model. To solve the above discrepancy, we developed the usual cell model into a more realistic one with the outermost layer of the secondary wall (S1 layer); thereafter, we discuss the action of the S1 layer upon the dimensional changes of the cell model during the secondary wall lignification. From this analysis, we can explain the experimental phenomena more rationally by considering the action of the S1 layer. This suggests that the anisotropic growth stresses in cell walls are generated on the basis of the mechanism of the `'unified hypothesis'' during lignification not only in the middle layer of the secondary wall (S2 layer) but also in the S1 layer.}},
