(1) Longitudinal shrinkages in broadleaved trees which contained tension woods increased in proportion to the contractive released strains. Longitudinal shrinkages in the gelatinous layers were estimated to be about four times greater than those in normal cell walls: namely, the CMFs tended to contract largely in length as a result of the loss of water. This indicates the possibility that the CMFs contract and generate large tensile stresses in their axial directions also during cell maturation. (2) Contractive released strains increased as MFAs decreased and as the alpha-cellulose contents increased in sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) and yurinoki (Liriodendron tulipifera L.). (3) According to a simulation of the growth stress evolution by a cell model described in a previous report, the generation of tensile growth stresses was considered to be controlled by an interaction between the Young's modulus in the CMFs and the contractions of the CMFs in addition to the MFAs.}},

Numerous studies have been devoted to the cellulose microfibril arrangement, providing the longitudinal strength of the fiber, while less is known regarding the structural organization of other components, such as hemicelluloses and lignin. For the hemicelluloses, as being part of the cellulose aggregation process, indications of a strong coupling to the cellulose structure have been shown. For lignin, being laid down in a later stage, no clear picture has emerged. Here the orientation of lignin vis-à-vis the cellulose orientation was examined for a number of different fiber structures. It was shown that the lignin in the middle lamella region seems to be non-oriented, thus more resembling an isotropic material, while the lignin in the secondary wall is to some extent oriented. The orientation of this lignin is less pronounced than the orientation of cellulose but has a preferential alignment in the direction of the fiber axis. The reason for this alignment could be related to structural restrictions of this lignin, deposited in the spaces remaining after the initial forming of the structured cellulose/hemicellulose fibrillar structure.},

The critical MFA; namely, microfibril angle where the longitudinal growth stress switches from contraction to expansion, becomes quite larger than the experimental one in the case of using a usual cell model. To solve the above discrepancy, we developed the usual cell model into a more realistic one with the outermost layer of the secondary wall (S1 layer); thereafter, we discuss the action of the S1 layer upon the dimensional changes of the cell model during the secondary wall lignification. From this analysis, we can explain the experimental phenomena more rationally by considering the action of the S1 layer. This suggests that the anisotropic growth stresses in cell walls are generated on the basis of the mechanism of the `'unified hypothesis'' during lignification not only in the middle layer of the secondary wall (S2 layer) but also in the S1 layer.}},

  abstract = {{To obtain an experimental foundation for a hypothesis on the origin of growth stress in the cell wall, the numerical relationships between anatomical factors, Klason lignin content, and the longitudinal released strain of the growth stress were investigated, especially in the compression wood region. In the compression wood region, the longitudinal expansive released strain had positive correlations with the Klason lignin content, the microfibril angle (MFA), the darkness of the color, and the fractions of the cell wall area and the intercellular space area. It had also an inverse correlation with Young's modulus in the cell wall substance. Longitudinal expansive released strains were measured also in the opposite wood region in spite of the small values. The following conclusions were made. (1) In the compression wood region, generation of the compressive growth stress is controlled by an interaction between a large MFA and a large deposition of lignin in addition to anatomical factors, the thickness of the cell wall, and the Young's modulus of the cell wall substance. This suggests that the mechanism of the lignin swelling hypothesis takes part in the generation of the compressive growth stress in the compression wood region. (2) The longitudinal expansive released strain becomes larger with the increase of the degrees of compression wood. Therefore, the degrees of compression wood can be estimated easily and accurately by measuring the longitudinal released strain of the growth stress.}},

The expansive released strain in the longitudinal direction assumed large values as the lignin content increased in the compression wood, but there was no relation between released strain and lignin content in the normal wood region. The contractive released strain assumed large values as the cellulose content and its crystallinity increased. Their correlation was very high and clear. From these facts, it is considered that the lignin deposition plays an important role in the generation of the growth stresses in compression wood but is not important in normal or tension wood regions. Cellulose microfibrils contract along their longitudinal axis during cell maturation, and the stress included by the contraction creates a longitudinal growth stress in normal and tension woods.}},

Different methods of analysis of the effects of wood microstructures at different scale levels on the mechanical behaviour deformation and strength of wood are discussed and compared. Micromechanical models of deformation and strength of wood are divided into three groups: cellular models (applied most often to the mesoscale or cell scale analysis of the wood deformation), continuum micromechanics and homogenization based methods, models which consider wood as a composite and are applied mainly to the analysis of wood at the microscale (cell wall scale) level and multiscale models. Lattice and composite models, which are used to analyze the damage and fracture of wood, are considered in a separate section. The areas of applicability and strong sides of each approach are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
