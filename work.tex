\section{Theoretical work}
Over the years there have been a number of attempts to mathematically model
cells (usually fibres or tracheids) from cell wall constituents (Mark 1967,
Koponen et al. 1989, Harrington et al. 1998, Yamamoto and Kojima 2002, Kojima
and Yamamoto 2004 are a few example) however very few efforts have used these
techniques to investigate the formation of growth stresses (archer 1987,
Yamamoto 1998, Guitard et al. 1999).
