\label{subsection:Theoretical work}
Over the years there have been a number of attempts to mathematically model plant
cell walls (usually fibres or tracheids) from cell wall constituents e.g. \citet{mark1967cell,Astley_1998,Yamamoto_2002} and \citet{Kojima_2004}. However very few efforts have used these
techniques to investigate the formation of growth stresses \citep{Archer_1987Yamamoto_1998,Guitard_1999}).
