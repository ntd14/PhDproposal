\section{Proposed theoretical and experimental work}
\subsection{Theoretical work}
Over the years there have been a number of attempts to mathematically model plant
cell walls (usually fibres or tracheids) from cell wall constituents \cite{mark1967cell}, \cite{Astley_1998}, \cite{Yamamoto_2002}, \cite{Kojima_2004} are a few example. However very few efforts have used these
techniques to investigate the formation of growth stresses (\cite{Archer_1987},
\cite{Yamamoto_1998}, \cite{Guitard_1999}).
