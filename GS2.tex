\citet{MARTLEY01011928} was possibly the first to study growth stresses in a scientific
manner. Initially he argued that the curvature of planks sawed from logs was due
to the current growth not being able to support the dead weight of the tree until
lignification was complete. As a result the centre is under compression while
the periphery had zero stress. However calculations showed that the self weight
was not sufficient to cause the observed longitudinal dimension changes of the
timber.
