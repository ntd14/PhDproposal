\chapter{Importance and contribution of research}
Mathematical modeling of how the xylem cells mature after primary
wall expansion will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms
responsible for growth stress production. Information regarding the mechanisms
for growth stress production is useful for fundamental understanding of
wood formation, as well as its potential use in biomimetic materials and
genetic modification of trees.
