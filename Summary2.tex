The proposed research will increase our understanding of the mechanisms behind
growth stress formation through the development of a mathematical model taking
into account a realistic cell wall supramolecular architecture to simulate
maturation. The geometric parameters of the cell wall molecular architecture and
chemical composition will be studied using x-ray diffraction, atomic force
microscopy and wet chemistry techniques. Experimentation will also be used to
investigate the role of the gelatinous (G) cell wall layer in the formation of
extreme tension wood.
