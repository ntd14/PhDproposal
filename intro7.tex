In order for the living cambial cells to produce wood, each cell must go through
division from its parent cell, growth and death. Because the cambium (and apical
meristem) are continually dividing it allows for the tree to be a dynamic
structure changing its form to become better adapted to its current
environmental setting even though large portions (ie the wood) are dead.
