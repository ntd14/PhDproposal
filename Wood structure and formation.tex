\section{Wood structure and formation}
Softwoods have a simpler microstructure than hardwoods, consisting mainly of
axially elongated tracheids which provide both mechanical support and water
transport \cite{bowyer2007forest}. Hardwoods contain a more complex micro structure with a number
of different cell types. Fibres, similar to softwood tracheids provide
structural support however it is their primary function, with vessels providing
conduction. Vessels are comprised of
multiple vessel elements being joined at the ends to form long conduits, which
can extend short distances (often less than 200mm) or can be as long as the
height of the tree \cite{walker1993primary}.
