\section{Wood structure and formation}
Softwoods have a simpler microstructure than hardwoods, consisting mainly of
axially elongated tracheids which provide both mechanical support and water
transport --ref--. Tracheids are the dominant form of cells within the stems and
branches --ref--. Hardwoods contain a more complex micro structure with a number
of different cell types. Fibres, similar to softwood tracheids provide
structural support however it is their primary function, with vessels providing
conduction --ref--.
