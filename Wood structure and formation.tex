\subsection{Wood structure and formation}
Softwoods have a simpler microstructure than hardwoods, consisting mainly of
axially elongated tracheids which provide both mechanical support and water
transport \cite{bowyer2007forest}. Hardwoods can contain a more complex microstructure with a number
of different cell types. Fibres, similar to softwood tracheids provide,
structural support however it is their only function, with vessels providing
conduction. Vessels are comprised of
multiple vessel elements being joined at the ends to form long conduits,
forming a network from the bottom to  the top of the tree \cite{walker1993primary}. Rays are formed from radially orientated  parenchyma cells (and rarely tracheids). Rays provide a mechanical advantage by diverting the axial force and reducing buckling and shear stresses between fibres \cite{mattheck1997wood}. Other cell types and functions exist, but more detailed wood anatomy and
has little bearing on this project and is discussed in a number of wood anatomy
texts e.g. \cite{fromm2013cellular}.
