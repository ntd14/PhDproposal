It is expected that the base model and parameters will be similar to those
utilised to describe lignin swelling by \cite{Alm_ras_2005} and \cite{Yamamoto_1998}. Cell wall layer radii, thickness, S2 layer MFA, moduli of the CMF bundles and matrix will all be included. Additional variables will be included
as necessary. It is intended to add the standard deviation of the MFA within the
cell wall layers, as in \cite{Harrington_1998}, pore size (or conversely fibril
aggregate size) (\cite{Fahl_n_2005}, \cite{Chang_2014}, \cite{BIORESBioRes_07_1_0521_Salmen_OSSR_Struc_Organis_Wood_Polymers}, \cite{Kim_2011}) and cell wall
constituents (\cite{Baba_2009}, \cite{Donaldson_2001}) and layer properties/geometries
(\cite{Bergander_2002}
