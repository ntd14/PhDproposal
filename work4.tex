It is expected that the base model and parameters will be similar to those
utilised to describe lignin swelling by \citet{Alm_ras_2005} and \citet{Yamamoto_1998}. Cell wall layer radii, thickness, MFA, moduli of the CMF bundles and matrix will all be included. Additional variables will be included
as necessary. It is intended to add the standard deviation of the MFA within the
cell wall layers, as in \citet{Harrington_1998}, pore size (or conversely fibril
aggregate size) \citep{Fahl_n_2005,Chang_2014,BIORESBioRes_07_1_0521_Salmen_OSSR_Struc_Organis_Wood_Polymers,Kim_2011} and cell wall
constituents \citep{Baba_2009,Donaldson_2001} and layer properties/geometries
\cite{Bergander_2002,grozdits1984differentiation,Alm_ras_2005,Yamamoto_1998,Chang_2014,ISI:A1995QJ03000001} to form a model, conceptually similar to the qualitative
architecture presented by \citet{Mellerowicz_2011}, \citet{Salm_n_2009} and others. Boundary conditions will be initially derived from those
presented by \citet{Alm_ras_2005} and further modified for increased realism
and/or usability of later models.
