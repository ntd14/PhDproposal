It is expected that the base model and parameters will be similar to those
utilised to describe lignin swelling by Almeras  et. al. (2005) and Yammamoto
(1998). Cell wall layer radii, thickness, S2 layer MFA, moduli of the CMF
bundles and matrix will all be included. Additional variables will be included
as necessary. It is intended to add the standard deviation of the MFA within the
cell wall layers, as in Harrington (1998), pore size (or conversely fibril
aggregate size) (Fahlen 2005, Chang 2014, Salmen 2012, Kim 2012) and cell wall
constituents (Baba 2009, Donaldson et al. 2001) and layer properties/geometries
(Bergander 2002, Grozdits 1982, Almeras 2005, Yammamoto 1995, 1998, Chang 2014,
salmen 2002) to form a model, conceptually similar to the qualitative
architecture presented by Mellerowicz et al. 2012, salmen 2009 and others --try
to find original--. Boundary conditions will be initially derived from those
presented by Almeras et. al. (2005) and further modified for increased realism
and/or usability of later models.
