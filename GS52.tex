\subsection{Why growth stresses exist}
Hardwoods typically have much larger growth stress magnitudes than softwoods \cite{barnett1981xylem}. Some young conifers have been
reported to have larger compressive stress at the periphery than at the pith \cite{jacobs1945l}, this may be due to the abundance of compression wood observed in juvenile conifers \cite{timell1986compression}. Once older they follow the same radial stress profile
as hardwoods.
