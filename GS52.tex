\section{Why growth stresses exist}
Hardwoods typically have much larger growth stress magnitudes than softwoods.
--why-- \cite{barnett1981xylem} Some young conifers have been
reported to have larger compressive stress at the stem than at the pith,
this may be attributed to the abundance of compression wood in juvenile
conifers observed by some. Once older they follow the same radial stress profile
as hardwoods.
