All trials at Harewood are set out as randomised individual tree trials. Principally
this work will be concerned with \textit{E. bosistoana} of which there  are two
trials. One with 8 replicates of 20 families, planted in 2012 and coppiced in
2013 (check these), due to be harvested in spring/summer 2015. The other
\textit{E. bosistoana} trial has 10 replicates of 20 families, was planted in
(2010) and harvested for the first time in 2012, the plants were then coppiced
and harvested again in December 2014. Four families representing the highest and
lowest growth stress generating genetics were coppiced for a second time and
will be due for harvest in 2016. Preliminary results from the 2012 and 2014
harvests show heritability of growth strain generated family
rankings. The same data was collected from \textit{E. argophloia} plants planted
in 2010 measured and coppiced in 2012, with final measurements completed in 2014.
