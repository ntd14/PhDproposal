\cite{brodzki1972} hypothesised strains due to 1,3-linked glucan (laricinan)
deposition within the helical checks of the S2 cell wall layer could be the
most significant factor in longitudinal growth stress generation. \cite{boyd1977basic}
refuted this idea arguing (along with other issues) that the laricinan would
expand into the cell lumen not causing any stresses in the cell wall, unless a
(non-observed) constraining median restricted the expansion.
