Proposed model of the cell:
Modelling of a generic single cell with variable cell wall parameters to
investigate the required geometry and constituents to create maximum
longitudinal and tangential extension and contraction via the lignin swelling
hypothesis. The single cell model should have the capacity to put limits on the
magnitude of stress generation the lignin swelling hypothesis is theoretically
capable of under different constituent and geometric makeups.
