\subsection{Issues growth stresses cause }

At harvesting growth stresses are released by the saw cut (and crosscutting etc)
and can ruin structural and veneer logs due to the resulting splitting and
warping. Growth stresses, particularly reaction growth stresses increase the
danger for the faller by effects such as saws binding and `barber chairing`.
