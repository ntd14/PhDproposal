End splits, heart checks, and ring shakes all reduce the value of the timber in
a stem. When the stem is felled or cross cut, growth stresses are released
around the saw cuts causing shortening at the periphery and extension in the
centre. The dimension change is maximum at the saw cut, reducing as distance
from the cut increases. When the contraction/extension force exceeds the plastic
limit of the stem splitting occurs.
