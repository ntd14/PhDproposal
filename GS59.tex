End splits, heart checks, and ring shakes all reduce the value of the stem. When the stem is felled or cross cut, growth stresses are released
around the saw cuts causing shortening at the periphery and extension in the
centre. The dimensional change is maximal at the saw cut. Splitting occurs when the contraction/extension force exceeds the plastic
limit of the stem.
