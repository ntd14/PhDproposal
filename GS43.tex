Growth stresses studies have been largely confined to model, or common species
however there are a number of species which appear to form intermediates or
abnormal forms of reaction wood. For example Hebe and Buxus are angiosperms which appear
to form compression wood rather than tension wood \cite{Kojima_2011} \cite{Yoshizawa_1992}.
