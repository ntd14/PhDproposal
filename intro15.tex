\section{Cells and wood in the context of a whole tree}
Wood as a material within the tree has three major functions to achieve; water
transport, nutrient transport and mechanical structure --ref--. Softwoods
achieve water transport and mechanical structure within tracheids, while
parenchyma cells are used for nutrient transport. Hardwoods have evolved a more
complicated internal structure of vessels and fibres in order to separates out
the functions of transport and mechanical support respectively.
