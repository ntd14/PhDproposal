\section{Cells and wood in the context of a whole tree}
Wood as a material within the tree has three major functions to achieve; water
and nutrient transport and storage and mechanical structure. Softwoods
achieve water transport and mechanical structure with tracheids, while
parenchyma cells are used storage. Hardwoods have evolved a more
complicated internal structure of vessels and fibres in order to separates out
the functions of transport and mechanical support respectively \cite{walker1993primary}.
