\section{Cellular modeling not focusing on growth stresses}
A number of mathematical models have been presented from the
molecular to cellular and whole organ level, unfortunately as
growth stress was not a primary concern to these researches they are neglected.
Luckily these works have made significant advancements in other areas of
understanding which need to be incorporated into growth stress research (for a review see \cite{ISI:000261731700022}). --maybe
a little on these advances, ----- Breifly discuss the math
tecneques used---Has any one used descrete or hybrid systems?---
