\section{Cellular modeling not focusing on growth stresses}
A number of mathematical models have been presented from the
molecular to the cellular (and whole organ) level, unfortunately as
growth stress was not a primary concern to these researches they are neglected.
Luckily these works have made significant advancements in other areas of
understanding which need to be incorporated into growth stress research. --maybe
a little on these advances, ---Ref a review paper \cite{ISI:000261731700022} ----- Breifly discuss the math
tecneques used---Has any one used descrete or hybrid systems?---
