\subsection{Cellular modeling not focusing on growth stresses}
A number of mathematical models have been presented from the
molecular to cellular and whole organ level. Growth stress was not usually included.
However these works have made significant advancements in other areas of
understanding of plant cell walls which need to be incorporated into growth stress research (for a review see \citet{ISI:000261731700022}).
