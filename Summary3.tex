The New Zealand Dryland Forest Initiative (NZDFI) is currently breeding
\textit{Eucalyptus bosistoana} as a high value timber crop alternative to
\textit{Pinus radiata}. One of the goals of the breeding trials is to select for
minimal growth stresses so that the timber does not lose value when harvesting
and milling due to the release of internal stresses. The proposed research will
select families at young ages which are producing the lowest possible growth
stresses improving the \textit{E. bosistoana} breeding stock.
