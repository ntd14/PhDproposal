More recently theories regarding the nature of hemicelluloses and their bonding
have been used in an attempt to remove some of the issues associated with the
cellulose contraction hypothesis. One major issue of cellulose contraction is
that in its initial form it was argued that the crystallisation process of cellulose
shortened its length but when cellulose crystallised it becomes
longer as the chains straighten out. Two theories have been advanced to combat
the issue of lengthening during crystallisation in order to retain an updated
version of the cellulose contraction hypothesis.
