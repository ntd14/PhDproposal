Archer followed up his series on growth stress distribution with `On the origin
of growth stresses' \citep{archer1987,archer1989} where he attempted to mathematically investigate individual
cells, presenting an explicit relationship between strains and growth
increment of the cell wall. The relationship relates MFA and swelling strain,
he argues that these results are consistent with the lignin swelling hypothesis
for compression wood. In tension wood, by increasing the ratio of area of cell
wall to total cell cross sectional area by adding a G layer could theoretically
(with the parameters Archer used) produce a tensile stress of 36MPa.
