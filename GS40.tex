There have been a number of studies published where the surface strains of stems have been recorded using various methods \cite{Muneri_1999} \cite{Yang_2002}\cite{Murphy_2005}\cite{Chauhan_2004}. Most recently Near Infrared spectroscopy (NIR) has been used for non destructive testing.\cite{Watanabe_2011} was able to use NIR to predict growth strain in Sugi moderately accurately.
