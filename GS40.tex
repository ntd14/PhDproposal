There have been a number of studies published where the surface strains of stems have been recorded using various methods \citep{Muneri_1999,Yang_2002,Murphy_2005,Chauhan_2004,Raymond_2004}. Most recently Near Infrared spectroscopy (NIR) has been used for non destructive testing.\citet{Watanabe_2011} was able to use NIR to predict growth strain in Sugi moderately accurately.
