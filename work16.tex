Technique two; Straight one year old stems (from coppice, and seedlings of a
mixture of camadulensis, tricarpa and quadrangulata) will be bent and restrained
and allowed to growth for a further three months, with regular adjusting of the
restraints to avoid cambium damage. Normal wood samples can be collected from
these stems from wood produced away from the bend site. These plants will be
selected from camaldulensis (reported to produce S1-G tension wood (Baba 1996)),
quadrangualata and tricarpa depending on the suitability of the plants
available, and there ability to produce a G-layer will be investigated with
microscopy with staining --stain ref--.
