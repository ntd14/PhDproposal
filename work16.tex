Technique two; Straight one year old stems (from coppice, and seedlings of a
mixture of \textit{E. camadulensis, E. tricarpa and E. quadrangulata} will be bent and restrained
and allowed to grow for a further three months, with regular adjusting of the
restraints to avoid cambium damage. Normal wood samples can be collected from
these stems higher up where they are straight.
