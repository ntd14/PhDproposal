AFM and electron microscopy have been used to probe the cell wall at the scale of fibril aggregates, showing that the fibrils are not straight and instead meander through the cell wall in a general direction. The fibril aggregates join and separate creating a distribution of pore sizes and shapes. Fibril aggregates architecture has yet to be incorporated into cellular models.
