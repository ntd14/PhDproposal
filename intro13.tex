In tension wood of some species a Gelatinous layer (G-layer)
is formed on the inside of the innermost wall (S1, S2 or S3)\cite{gardiner2014biology}. The
G-layer has near vertically oriented microfibrils and very little lignification.
It is suspected that the G-layer plays an important role in the generation of
reorientation stresses \cite{Pilate_2004}.
