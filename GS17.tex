Through the late 70's and 80's archer produced a number of papers in two series,
`on the distribution of growth stresses' \cite{Archer_1974}\cite{archer1976}\cite{Archer_1979}\cite{Archer_1981}\cite{Archer_1985} mainly concerning the
mathematical treatment of the stress fields within trees. --- and `on the
origin of growth stresses' \cite{archer1987}\cite{archer1989} primarily concerned with the underlying
mechanisms generating growth stresses.
