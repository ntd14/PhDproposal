\citet{Guitard_1999} used a S2 layer model which took the transmission of shear
between fibres into account, resulting in non-zero shear moduli. Previously
integral conditions had been used to govern the longitudinal stresses,
presumably as they satisfy the necessary condition implicit within stress field
equilibrium conditions. \citet{Guitard_1999} introduced a local condition on
every elementary volume. They argue that although this approach does not satisfy
the necessary equilibrium conditions it provides better agreement with
experimental results when combined with dimensional changes within the
microfibril bundle. In particular this model provides a much better prediction
of transverse strains while being less complex than previous attempts.
