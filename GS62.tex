It
is expected that typical breeding statistical techniques will be applicable. The
two objectives to be achieved for the breeding trials are to estimate genetic
parameters, (in particular heritability of growth strain) and to predict
breeding values for families. Mixed model methods are commonly used within tree
and animal breeding for these purposes.
