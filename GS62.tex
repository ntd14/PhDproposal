Although the particular statistical techniques best suited to the data set
obtained from the trial results canâ€™t be known before the data is collected, it
is expected that typical breeding statistical techniques will be applicable. The
two objectives to be achieved for the breeding trials are to estimate genetic
parameters, (in particular heritability of growth stresses) and to predict
breeding values for families. Mixed model methods are commonly used within tree
and animal breeding for these purposes.
