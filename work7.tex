\subsection{Experimental work}
Currently neither lignin swelling or cellulose contraction (described in section
\ref{section:GS}) have any direct experimental evidence. The tension which cellulose is under
on the stem periphery has been directly measured using x-ray diffraction showing
a strain reduction of 0.2\% in cellulose when the stress is released \citep{Clair_2006}.
