The primary cell wall has randomly orientated MFs embedded
in hemicellulose and pectic compounds --ref-- and becomes lignified after S layer is added --ref--.
The ML is non lignified, note often compound middle laminar (CML) is used to describe
the ML and P at once as it is often hard to distinguish between the two. Once the cell has reached its
full size biosynthesis of the S1 starts --ref--.
