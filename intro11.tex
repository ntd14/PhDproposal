The primary cell wall has randomly orientated MFs embedded
in hemicellulose and pectic compounds and becomes lignified when S layers are added.
The ML is highly lignified, note often compound middle laminar (CML) is used to describe
the ML and P at once as it is often hard to distinguish between the two. Once the cell has reached its
full size biosynthesis of the S1 starts \cite{fromm2013cellular}.
