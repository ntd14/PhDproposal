Yamamoto et al. produced a number of papers entitled `Generation Process of
Growth Stresses in Cell walls` \cite{ISI:A1991FD97000001}\cite{ISI:A1992HP18200001}\cite{ISI:A1993LM28800002}\cite{ISI:A1993LE99600003}\cite{ISI:A1995QJ03000001} (and \cite{ISI:A1988R357800002}\cite{ISI:A1990EL71100002} in Japanese) where both the lignin swelling
hypothesis and the cellulose contraction hypothesis are considered in detail,
including new experimental evidence for each. They conclude that neither hypothesis suitably explains the experimental evedince. They find the critical MFA to be between 25 and 35 $^{\circ}$ for lignin swelling from both experimental evidence and an updated cell wall model including the effects of the S1 layer.
