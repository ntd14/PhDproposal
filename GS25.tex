Yamamoto et al. produced a number of papers entitled `Generation Process of
Growth Stresses in Cell walls` \cite{ISI:A1991FD97000001}\cite{ISI:A1992HP18200001}\cite{ISI:A1993LM28800002}\cite{ISI:A1993LE99600003}\cite{ISI:A1995QJ03000001} (and \cite{ISI:A1988R357800002}\cite{ISI:A1990EL71100002} in Japanese) where both the lignin swelling
