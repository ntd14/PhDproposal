Typically when attempting to determine the reasons for why wood properties exist
one of four hypothesis are used; mechanical, hydraulic, time dependent and a
combination of the previous three. Initial speculation as the the reason for
growth stresses existence came from \cite{MARTLEY01011928} who briefly entertained the
mechanical hypothesis based on self weight. \cite{jacobs1945l} suggested they were a
byproduct of sap tension, which he later retracted when sap
pressures were recalculated at a much lower value than the generally believed
values at the time \cite{jacobs1965l}.
