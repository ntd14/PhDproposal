Typically when attempting to determine the reasons for why wood properties exist
one of four hypothesis are used; mechanical, hydraulic, time dependent and a
combination of the previous three. Initial speculation as the the reason for
growth stresses existence came from \cite{MARTLEY01011928} who briefly entertained the
mechanical hypothesis based on self weight. \cite{jacobs1945l} suggested they were a
byproduct of sap tension, which he later retracted --Jacobs (196?)-- when sap
pressures were recalculated at a much lower value than the generally believed
values at the time. .. Growth stresses indubitable have an effect on the
mechanical stability of trees, although it is conceivable that the effect may be
byproduct of another driver.
