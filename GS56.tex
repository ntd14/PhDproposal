Typically when attempting to determine the reasons for why wood properties exist
one of four hypotheses are used; mechanical, hydraulic, time dependent and a
combination of the previous three. Initial speculation for the existence of
growth stresses came from \citet{MARTLEY01011928} who briefly entertained the
mechanical hypothesis based on self weight. \citet{jacobs1945l} suggested they were a
byproduct of sap tension, which he later retracted when sap
pressures were recalculated at a much lower value (pressures of 200 atm was reduced to 30 atm) than the generally believed
values at the time \citep{jacobs1965l}.
