\section{Cell division, formation, elongation and death}
Dicotyledons and gymnosperms grow in two main ways, upward apical growth and
outward cambial growth.  As the cambium is forming, fusiform and ray initials
are created from the apical shoot cells --ref--. From the cambial initials,
cells to the inside create the vertical elements of xylem (tracheids, vessels,
fibers, parenchyma, etc.), while cells outside become phloem--ref--. Ray
initials produce horizontal elements (rays)--ref--.
