Okuyama et al (1981) adopted the use of strain gauges to measure stem surface
stresses of particular layers of wood. Other methods were also derived around
the same time, Guenau and chardin 1973, Guenau and Kikata 1973, and kikata and
kiwa 1977 investigated drilling holes near strain gauges to release strains.
Saurat and Gueneau 1974, 1976 introduced an apparatus which utilised two knife
blades at a set distance, one knife blade bent as the strain was released via
drilling the strain release was measured on the blade.
