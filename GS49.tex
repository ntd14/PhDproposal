As reviewed by \cite{kubler_1987}, \cite{Okuyama_1981} adopted the use of strain gauges to measure stem surface
stresses of particular layers of wood. Other methods were also derived around
the same time, \cite{gueneau1973}\cite{gueneau1973b} and \cite{kikata1977} investigated drilling holes near strain gauges to release strains.
\cite{Gueneau1974} and \cite{Saurat_1976} introduced an apparatus which utilised two knife
blades at a set distance, one knife blade bent as the strain was released via
drilling the strain release was measured on the blade.
