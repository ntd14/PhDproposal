As reviewed by \citet{kubler_1987}, \citet{Okuyama_1981} adopted the use of strain gauges to measure stem surface
stresses of particular layers of wood. Other methods were also derived around
the same time, \citet{gueneau1973,gueneau1973b} and \citet{kikata1977} investigated drilling holes near strain gauges to release strains.
\citet{Gueneau1974} and \citet{Saurat_1976} introduced an apparatus which utilised two knife
blades at a set distance, one knife blade bent as the strain was released via
drilling. The strain release was measured on the curved blade.
