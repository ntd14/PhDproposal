At some point during the formation of the secondary cell wall, or soon after the
cell shrinks vertically and expands tangentially \citep{Boyd_1972} (with the exception of
some young softwoods, where the opposite occurs \citep{jacobs1945l}). Because of the connectedness
between cells a stress profile forms within the stem, this phenomenon is discussed
in greater detail in Section \ref{section:GS}. After the secondary wall formation cell death
occurs.
