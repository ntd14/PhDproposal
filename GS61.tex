Within mills during processing growth stresses cause a number of issues leading
to reductions in value recovery. Because growth stresses are released when the
stem is sectioned via sawing (plain, quarter etc.) the resulting shape change
can cause the saws to jam. The main value loss at this stage of processing comes
from the need to saw boards multiple times in order to release the stresses
while still allowing for the final board dimensions to be retrieved.
Increasing the number of times the boards are sawed to get their end dimensions
gives not only poor saw use efficiency but the major economic loss comes from the
final yield being as low as 30%.
