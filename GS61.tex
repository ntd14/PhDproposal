Within mills during processing growth stresses cause a number of issues leading
to reductions in value recovery. Because growth stresses are released when the
stem is sectioned via sawing, the resulting shape change
can cause the saws to jam. The main value loss at this stage of processing comes
from the need to saw boards multiple times in order to straighten deformed boards.
Increasing the number of times the boards are sawed to get their end dimensions
gives not only poor saw use efficiency but also major economic loss, the
final yield can be reduced to 30\% \citep[oral presentation]{yamamoto2007slides}.
