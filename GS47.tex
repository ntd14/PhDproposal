\section{Experimentation}
Currently there are three commonly used experimental methods for measuring
surface strains. The Nicholson method, the `French' method and the strain
gauge method as reviewed by \cite{Murphy_2005} and \cite{yang2005measurement}. A detailed comparison between systems was undertaken by \cite{kamarudin2014new}, incluing a new system called GSM10.
