\subsection{Experimentation}
Currently there are three commonly used experimental methods for measuring
surface strains. The Nicholson method, the `French' method and the strain
gauge method as reviewed by \citet{Murphy_2005,Yoshida_2002} and \citet{yang2005measurement}. A detailed comparison between the systems was undertaken by \citet{kamarudin2014new}, including a new system called GSM10.
