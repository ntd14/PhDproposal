Individual trachieds of spruce have been investigated for swelling after soaking in a sodium iodide solution. \cite{Burgert_2007} found substantial swelling of compression wood tracheids and slight swelling of normal tracheids. They argue these results show the potential for swelling governed only by cell wall architecture to be sufficient to generate the tensile and compressive forces observed.
