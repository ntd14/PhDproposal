\citet{boyd1950a} developed a new experimental technique in order to investigate the
stress profile further. By cutting a slit longitudinal in the centre of the
log, attaching strain gauges onto the wood inside the slit and successively
shortening the log from both ends he obtained direct extension measurements from
inside the stem. He found the point of crossover from longitudinal tension to compression was approximately two thirds the radius out from the pith.
