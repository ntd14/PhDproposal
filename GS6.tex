Boyed (1950) developed a new experimental technique in order to investigate the
stress profile further. By cutting a slit longitudinal in the centre of the
log, attaching strain gauges onto the wood inside the slit and successively
shortening the log from both ends he obtained direct extension measurements from
inside the stem. --found that the crossover point is is about 1/3 rad of the log
from the periphery--
