\caption{Narrow sense heritability of the measured wood properties. Large credible intervals are present on all heritability estimates, emphasising the need for large sample sizes. Growth-strain is under substantial genetic control (\(\sim\) 400 plants from seed and \(\sim\) 200 from coppice).}

Property          & Heritability & 95\% Credible Interval \\
Diameter          & 0.27         & 0.087 - 0.46           \\
Dry density       & 0.45         & 0.23 – 0.67            \\
