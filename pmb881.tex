\caption{Tab. 2: Narrow sense heritability of the measured wood properties. Large credible intervals are present on all heritability estimates, emphasising the need for large sample sizes. Growth-strain is under substantial genetic control (\(\sim\) 400 plants from seed and \(\sim\) 200 from coppice).}
