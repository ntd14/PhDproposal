\chapter{Summary}
Growth stresses form in most tree species, in Eucalyptus (and many other
species) these internal stresses can be of a considerable magnitude, especially
in reaction wood. When a stem or branch is cut, some of the stress is released
in the form of strain, resulting in a number of timber defects which reduce log
value.
