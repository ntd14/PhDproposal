\textbf{Method}
The development of the splitting test, based on the pairing test (Chauhan 2010), has resulted in a simple and quick method of growth-strain measurement which can be used on small stems. The test relies on the release of stored strain energy in a single plane via cutting through the pith as can be seen in Fig. 1. Chauhan (2010) derived Equation 1 to estimate the deflection given growth-strain from the sample geometry.

\begin{equation}
Y_u = \frac{0.87 \epsilon L^2}{R_{avg}}
\end{equation}
  
 Where: \(Y_u\) is the deflection, \(\epsilon\) is the strain, \(L\) is the cut length and \(R_{avg}\) is the cross-section radius.
